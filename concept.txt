entered method / no capture:
  remember level in local

entered method / capture:
  remember level in local
  level++
  dispatcher
    dummy args
    enter interrupted method (direct call)                 | avoids restore of complete stack
    jump after normal method call (to "leave method" code) |
    PROBLEM: stack mismatch: special restore code or restore frame before method call

interrupt:
  capture frame
  set level to have being captured
  set capture

interrupt end:
  reset capture
  set level to have not being captured
  restore frame

left method / no capture:
  level--,
  set level to have not being captured
  restore frame

left method / capture:
  level--
  if level not captured
    capture frame
    set level to have being captured
  return

catch block:
  reset context to remembered level
  restore frame
  normal
